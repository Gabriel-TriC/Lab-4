Questions:

1. If you were implementing a sort algorithm for a new language, which sort would you use?

I would probably use insertion sort.

2. Was there a difference in the time it took for bubble and insertion sort to run?
Does this make sense given the time complexities for these sorting algorithms?

There was a big difference in the time it took for bubble and insertion sort to run, bubble sort taking around 10x longer
than insertion. To me this makes sense, although the time complexities for both are the same, bubble sort does more work 
than the insertion sort. Bubble goes through the list multiple times as it compares each 2 highlighted values as it moves 
down the list.

3. Which sort algorithm has an easier implemenation (in terms of understanding) to you?

I'd say that the insertion sort has easier implementation and it was a bit easier to understand for me.
